 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Wilmer's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   My coding journey began with no prior knowledge of the coding world. I initially started learning Web Development, starting with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. However, I soon discovered that my true passion lay in app development. This led me to explore different operating systems to find the best fit for my philosophy and preferences, ultimately choosing the path of iOS Development.

  Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Software Development at Brigham Young University, where I am acquiring strong expertise in designing and creating mobile applications. Throughout my first year of professional experience, I have taken on challenging projects and collaborated closely with diverse teams to design and develop high-performance native iOS applications.

My main focus centers around crafting intuitive and scalable applications, utilizing Swift as the programming language, and leveraging advanced tools and frameworks like Xcode and SwiftUI. Moreover, I have gained valuable experience in implementing APIs, integrating cloud services, and troubleshooting technical problems.
